# DataWarehouse
The principal motivation behind the Incident management system is to provide knowledge about technical incidents/issues, Bug generated in the field of Information technology in the year 2016-2017. It is nothing but the processing activity of an Information Technologies organization to analyze, identify, and fix the issue as well as to prevent a similar kind of issue in the future. The Source Data has been extracted from the service Now for the year 2016-2017 (Amaral & M., n.d.). The incidents are divided into three categories based on their priority namely Low, Medium, and High, Critical. Each priority defines the impact of the incident on the company and thereby defining the urgency of solving the issue. Each incident has an open date (the date when the incident was generated), closed date (the date when the incident was resolved), the impact of the issue, the urgency of solving the problem, and the priority required to solve the incident. This data is collected for an audit system for an instance of ServiceNow for the year 2016 (Amaral & M., n.d.).  and the dataset can be found and downloaded from the URL
